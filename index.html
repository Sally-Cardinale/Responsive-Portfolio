            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Sally Cardinale and I am a Full 
                Stack Web Developer (in training)! I have been a local government Program Specialist working in contract 
                support for the past 5 years, and have worked for local government in 
                various capacities for over 15 years.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about assisting underprivileged members of my community. 
                It has been a dream of mine to create a non-profit to help children dream 
                big, recognize their potential, and see past their present surroundings.</p>
            <p>I am a mom and a wife and I love spending time with my family. We love hiking, 
                game nights and going on scavenger hunts to explore our city. Please explore 
                my portfolio and feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a>
                me if you have any questions, or would like to connect. Have a great day!</p>
