      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Sally Cardinale and I am a Full 
        Stack Web Developer (in training)! I have been a local government Program Specialist working in contract 
        support for the past 5 years, and have worked for local government in 
        various capacities for over 15 years.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about assisting underprivileged members of my community. 
        It has been a dream of mine to create a non-profit to help children dream 
        big, recognize their potential, and see past their present surroundings.</p>
    <p>I am a mom and a wife and I love spending time with my family. We love hiking, 
        game nights and going on scavenger hunts to explore our city. Please explore 
        my portfolio and feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a>
        me if you have any questions, or would like to connect. Have a great day!</p>
